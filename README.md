# Deploying gradio app on heroku
Gradio is an open source python library that allows us to build, customize and share demos of our machine learning models, API, or any data science workflow.
With just a few lines of code, we can quickly and easily develop UI interfaces within our Python notebook or script, display the outcome of our final model and share it with anyone.

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
Heroku is open and extensible so developers can build in whichever language they choose i.e Nodejs, Ruby, PHP, Python, Java, etc.
